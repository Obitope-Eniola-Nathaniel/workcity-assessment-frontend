## Assumptions

* The backend API is secured with JWT, and all private routes require a Bearer token.
* The logged-in user is stored in context using React’s Context API.
* API responses follow standard REST patterns (e.g., `GET /clients`, `POST /projects`, etc.).


---

## Optional Enhancements

* Loading spinners or skeleton loaders
* Toast messages for success/errors
* Paginated client/project lists
* Filter or search clients/projects
